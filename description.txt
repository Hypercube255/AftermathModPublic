Aftermath is a mod which aims to add new content throughout the entirety of Terraria's progression. Currently, it is almost exclusively combat oriented, however I intend to introduce other kinds of features in the future.

Multiplayer support is coming soon-ish (hopefully)

Aftermath Mod adds:
-4 Bosses (+ 1 boss minion)
-1 Miniboss
-70+ Items
-3 Buffs/Debuffs
-1 Original boss theme (shared by 2 of the bosses)
-Boss Checklist support
